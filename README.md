Development repository for KeiHUD.  
These may contain unstable commits or undesirable changes to gameplay. Use at your own discretion!

# Installation:
Drag keihud folder into tf/custom.

# Compatibility?
Compatible with most screen resolutions. Switching it is the same as in regular SunsetHUD.  
My HUD should still retain compatibility with Linux.
